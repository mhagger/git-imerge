git-imerge -- incremental merge and rebase for git
==================================================

Perform the merge between two branches incrementally.  If conflicts
are encountered, figure out exactly which pairs of commits conflict,
and present the user with one pairwise conflict at a time for
resolution.

``git-imerge`` has two primary design goals:

* Reduce the pain of resolving merge conflicts to its unavoidable
  minimum, by finding and presenting the smallest possible conflicts:
  those between the changes introduced by one commit from each branch.

* Allow a merge to be saved, tested, interrupted, published, and
  collaborated on while it is in progress.

I think that it is easiest to understand the concept of incremental
merging visually, and therefore I recommend the video of my
`git-imerge presentation from the GitMerge 2013 conference`_ (20 min)
as a good place to start.  The full slides for that talk are available
in this repository under ``doc/presentations/GitMerge-2013``.  At the
same conference, I was interviewed about ``git-imerge`` by Thomas
Ferris Nicolaisen for his `GitMinutes Podcast #12`_.

To learn how to use the ``git-imerge`` tool itself, I suggest the blog
article `git-imerge: A Practical Introduction`_ and also typing
``git-imerge --help`` and ``git-imerge SUBCOMMAND --help``.  If you
want more information, the theory and benefits of incremental merging
are described in minute detail in a series of blog articles [1]_, as
are the benefits of retaining history when doing a rebase [2]_.

Multiple incremental merges can be in progress at the same time.  Each
incremental merge has a name, and its progress is recorded in the Git
repository as references under ``refs/imerge/NAME``.  The current
state of an incremental merge can be visualized using the ``diagram``
command.

An incremental merge can be interrupted and resumed arbitrarily, or
even pushed to a server to allow somebody else to work on it.

**git-imerge is experimental!  If it breaks, you get to keep the
pieces.  For example, it is recommended that you make a clone of your
git repository and run the script on the clone rather than the
original.  Feedback and bug reports are welcome!**


Instructions
============

For basic operation, you only need to know three ``git-imerge``
commands.  To merge ``BRANCH2`` into ``BRANCH1`` or rebase ``BRANCH2``
onto ``BRANCH1``, ::

    git checkout BRANCH1
    git-imerge start --name=NAME --goal=GOAL --first-parent BRANCH2
    while not done:
        <fix conflict presented to you and "git add" the changes>
        git-imerge continue
    git-imerge finish

where

``NAME``
    is the name for this merge (and also the default name of the
    branch to which the results will be saved).

``GOAL`` describes how you want to simplify the results (see next
    section).


Simplifying results
-------------------

When the incremental merge is finished, you can simplify its results
in various ways before recording it in your project's permanent
history.

discard the
intermediate merge commits and create a simpler history to record
permanently in your project repository using either the ``finish`` or
``simplify`` command.  The incremental merge can be simplified in one
of four ways:

``merge``
    keep only a simple merge of the second branch into the first
    branch, discarding all intermediate merges.  The end result is
    similar to what you would get from ::

        git checkout BRANCH1
        git merge BRANCH2

``manual``
    like ``merge``, but also keep any merges that had to be done
    manually plus enough automatic merges to connect the manual merges
    together meaningfully.  If the result is later discovered to be
    buggy, the additional information might be helpful in isolating
    the problem.

``rebase``
    keep the versions of the commits from the second branch rebased
    onto the first branch.  The end result is similar to what you
    would get from ::

        git checkout BRANCH2
        git rebase BRANCH1

``rebase-with-history``
    like ``rebase``, except that it retains the old versions of the
    rebased commits in the history.  It is equivalent to merging the
    commits from ``BRANCH2`` into ``BRANCH1``, one commit at a
    time. In other words, it transforms this::

        o---o---o---o          BRANCH1
             \
              A---B---C---D    BRANCH2

    into this::

        o---o---o---o---A'--B'--C'--D'   NEW_BRANCH
             \         /   /   /   /
              --------A---B---C---D

    It is safe to rebase an already-published branch using this
    approach.  See [2]_ for more information.

``full``
    don't simplify the incremental merge at all: do all of the
    intermediate merges and retain them all in the permanent history.
